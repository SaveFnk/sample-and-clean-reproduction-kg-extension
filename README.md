# sample-and-clean-reproduction-kg-extension
The project reimplements the Sample-and-Clean estimators (RawSC and NormalizedSC) and reproduces the experimental evaluation of the original SIGMOD 2014 paper. It further extends the framework to RDF knowledge graphs, applying it to the DBpedia persondata subset.
